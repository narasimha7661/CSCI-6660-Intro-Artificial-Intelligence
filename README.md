**Implementing a Chatbot Using Python**

This is our Artificial Intelligence Final Academic Project

We chose to create a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on a dataset containing categories (intents), patterns, and responses. Utilize a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify the user's message into a category and provide a random response from a predefined list.

In this Assignment we build an AI contextual Chatbot using the tensorflow and tflearn library we used the concepts of Natural Language Processing and Neural Network to build it. The intents file that we used for training is made by us.

**Introduction:**

Chatbots represent AI-driven entities capable of interacting with users or customers based on their intended use. They are an application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, especially pertinent in the rapidly advancing technological landscape. Across industries, there is a widespread effort to automate processes for enhanced service delivery, with chatbots emerging as a prominent application of automation.

There are two fundamental types of chatbots:

Command-Based Chatbots: These operate on predefined rules, responding to limited queries or questions. Users must select options to guide their interactions.

Intelligent/AI Chatbots: Leveraging Machine Learning and Natural Language Understanding, these chatbots comprehend user language and intelligently learn from conversations. Interactions can occur through text, speech, or graphical interfaces.

In this project, we developed an AI Chatbot tailored for the Medical Industry. Our focus was on addressing industry use cases by training the chatbot to respond not only to basic queries but also to pharmacy, medicine and hospital related inquiries beyond typical customer service scenarios.

**Use Cases:**

In this technological world every industry run behind AI and automation. One of the best application of integration of AI and Automation would be Chatbots. These are heavily used now-a-days. There are many diferent use cases of Chatbots in indutries. Some of them are,

Saves labour work
Provides 24x7 support
Instant service
Can entertain more number of people at same time
Easy Communication, etc

**Literature Review:**

Implementing AI Chatbots is prevalent across industries, with the core concepts involving Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural Networks. Various approaches, including the use of libraries like "chatterbot" in Python, have been explored. Our methodology drew inspiration from a blog on chatterbot by edureka.


**Results and Discussion:**
Our AI Chatbot demonstrated intelligence by successfully answering questions even if they deviated slightly from the training data. It adeptly replied within the context of the user's conversation.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, chatbots developed with a foundation in NLP and Neural Networks prove more efficient than those relying solely on pre-defined Python libraries. AI Chatbots contribute to time and labor savings, offering continuous 24/7 services with enhanced efficacy.
