Implementing a Chatbot Using Python(Model1)

This model contains:

train_chatbot.py:
This Python script is used for training the chatbot model. It contains code that reads the training data from intents.json, preprocesses it and builds a machine learning model. It also trains the model on the data, and saves the trained model in file chatbot_model.h5 along with other necessary files like words.pkl and classes.pkl.

intents.json:
This file contains the training data for our chatbot in JSON format and is used in the training process.

chatbot_model.h5:
This model is loaded during runtime to make predictions or generate responses and it contains the trained model for our chatbot. As we see this file is in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5)

words.pkl:
During training, the chatbot converts input sentences into a numerical format and this file stores the vocabulary learned during training.

classes.pkl:
This file is used to map predictions to their corresponding classes and it contains a serialized version of the classes representing different intents that the chatbot has been trained to recognize. 

In summary, these files collectively form a chatbot project. 


Getting Started

Download Files:
Download all the necessary files for the chatbot.

Open Command Prompt:
Open the command prompt on your system.

Navigate to the Folder:
Use the cd command to navigate to the folder where your chatbot files are located.

Check Module Installation:
Ensure that the required modules (tensorflow, keras, nltk, pickle) are installed. If not, install them using pip install module_name. If already installed, it will show "Requirement already satisfied."

Train the Model:
Execute the "train_chatbot.py" file with the command python train_chatbot.py. If the training is successful, it will display "Model created."

Open GUI Window:
To start a conversation with the chatbot, execute the "chatgui.py" file using python chatgui.py. This will open the GUI window.

Initiate Conversation:
Type your text in the section on the right of the send button, then click "Send" to receive responses.

ERROR GUIDE:
If you encounter an error like "ImportError: cannot import name 'tf_utils'" during the execution of "train_chatbot.py," follow these steps:

Uninstall Keras: pip uninstall keras
Reinstall Keras (specific version): pip install keras==2.2.0
Try executing the file again, and it should work properly.
